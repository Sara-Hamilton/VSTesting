(dry weight of the rocket * 2.718^( desired final speed / speed of rocket exhaust)) - dry weight of the rocket

 * Program should calculate the weight of fuel needed for a particular mission
	* Input: 2 ton (2000kg) rocket to the International Space Station (final speed of 9.4 km/s)
	* Output: 40,958 kg of fuel required


Equation:
double power = dest/exhaustD
double total = (weight * Math.Pow(2.718, power)) - weight
